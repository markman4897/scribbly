      <h2>the story behind this website</h2>
      <p>The idea for this website randomly arose one day, when I was playing a game of <a class="link"
          href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> with my friends and something bothered me. Specifically
        I didn't
        like how it's kind of annoying that your custom word list doesn't get saved in browser, so you need to save it
        manually not to lose it.</p>
      <p>On an unrelated note, not long before I was trying to make a game that would include a multiplayer element.
        Whilst browsing for ways to incorporate it, I found WebRTC.</p>
      <p>So when I was thinking about things I would add to <a class="link" href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> I
        remembered about this WebRTC thing and figured it would be a good
        practise to try to remake the fun drawing game in my own style.</p>
      <h3>Why I never finish projects</h3>
      <p>So starting this fine endeavour, I asked around a bit if anyone has tried to do this or something similar. You
        know, to get some tips on how to best approach this. While noone in my close friends group ever made a similar
        project, almost everyone advised to use some sort of CSS framework. I'm not kidding, literally
        <strong>everyone.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, as per usual, I said to myself "alright, lets make a vanilla CSS mockup and then we'll see". And
        this was the start of my demise.</p>
      <h3>Lucky strike with finding learning resources</h3>
      <p>First things first. If I want to even come close to making a <a class="link"
          href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> clone I'd need to make a very basic drawing application. And so the
        Googling journey begins.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly enough, the <a title="dev.to article" class="link"
          href="https://dev.to/0shuvo0/lets-create-a-drawing-app-with-js-4ej3">first result</a> had everything I needed.
        I quickly <s>copied over</s> learned about how to make a basic drawing app. A few modifications and BAM! Drawing
        part done.</p>
      <h3>There's more than one way to browse the web</h3>
      <p>Different people have different needs. That's an undisputable fact that should always be included into website
        development (among other things, of course). And by that I don't just mean people with disabilities, but also
        mean to point out that different people can have different preferences when it comes to browsing the internet.
      </p>
      <p>I'm no expert when it comes to accessibility, but I learned that there is a point to links having underlines
        and different colours and buttons changing visually when hovered over. The point is general recognition. People
        are more likely to notice that something is clickable if it looks like clickable things on other websites.</p>
      <p>There are also other things, as having a familiar layout of navigation elements and navigation through the
        clickable things with the tab key. Another important one is knowing when to use a specific HTML element as they
        usually have a <a title="article about HTML semantics"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics" class="link">semantic</a> meaning along
        with the functional one. And if you are ready to go the extra mile,
        there's <a title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" class="link">ARIA</a>.</p>
      <h3>Fun with CSS</h3>
      <p>So I have a love/hate relationship with CSS. I find its capabilities amazing and there's always something new
        "made with only CSS" that is just mind bending. When they added CSS Grids and Flexbox I felt like I can make any
        layout in the world.</p>
      <p>But then there's practical side. While I learned all my CSS from just fooling around with it and have
        accumulated knowledge for more years than I care to admit, there's always that one little thing that catches you
        off guard, something that doesn't quite work as it seems. If you ever written any, you know exactly what I'm
        talking about.</p>
      <p>What this boils down to is me, sitting behind a computer at 4am, thinking about how to make a box keep its darn
        aspect ratio when everything around it is responsive. And this leads to rewriting the whole CSS file, from
        ground up, for the 5th time... and the aspect ratio is still not fixed... and I just need sleep at this point.
      </p>
      <h3>Things take a weird turn</h3>
      <p>So at weird hours come weird ideas. After a few days of minimal sleep and a sleeping schedule of a vampire, I
        need a break. And what better way to relax than to listen to some chill music. And that, at least for me, would
        be old jazz.</p>
      <p>While searching for the right playlist I came across online jazz radios. Interesting. And jazz can be pretty
        old some times. Okay. Connect the two together and you find old public domain online jazz radio station. Fun.
      </p>
      <p>And because of sleep depravation and sudden spike of jazz appreciation, I get the bright idea to try and add
        this radio station onto my website. Lo and behold, it's pretty simple and 10 minutes later, we have a nice
        button at the top right that toggles the playback of the online radio station. Cool.</p>
      <p>But this arises a question. While usage of public domain material is fair game (most of the time), what about
        this specific radio station. The short and the long answer is "I don't know". If you, the reader, know more
        about this, please contact me via service you can find on the <a class="link" href="author.html">author</a>
        page.</p>
      <h3>Actually thinking through CSS</h3>
      <p>After a crushing defeat at the battle of CSS I finally came to my senses and decided to plan things out. I sat
        down in front of a blank piece of paper and drawn a phone, tablet and monitor.</p>
      <p>In reality, they were just different sized squares and I planned out a desired look for this webpage. A few
        iterations later I had something that made sense and started to rework the entire CSS file for the n-th time.
        But this time I had a plan.</p>
      <p>First things first, I decided to pursuit a <a
          href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00"
          class="link">mobile first approach</a>. This made things significantly easier and I have no idea why I never
        start like this.
        There's just something in the paper that makes me remember about this. But tl;dr: you should always plan first,
        before starting to write CSS files to oblivion and back.</p>
      <h3>Blissful ignorance</h3>
      <p>This should also be the time to plan the positioning of HTML attributes and think about general accessiblity.
        And to a degree, I did all that. But it's really easy to slip and think things through with a "design first,
        accessibility second" kind of approach and this is almost always a bad idea. But sometimes you just forget
        certain things. Good thing websites are not set in stone after you publish them.</p>
      <h3>the CSS gods show mercy</h3>
      <p>Usually when you don't know how to do something, you google it. But when you don't even know how to pose a
        question, you ask your developer friends (the only people willing to listen to your idea long enough to
        understand it).</p>
      <p>Funny thing is that some times (dare I say most of the time), after you explain your problem to a person, you
        gain some clarity about it yourself. So it even helps if you explain things to peolpe who don't necessarily know
        how to code just for that reason.</p>
      <p>Skip forward and after who knows how many iterations of CSS, I finally got it to play somewhat nicely. That
        mainly means nothing gets magically hidden or grows out of control at certain screen sizes. This is the time to
        try to open your website on every device you own and not forget about <strong>screen orientation</strong>.</p>
      <h3>oh hey, i can use this</h3>
      <p>I'm studying informatics and that brings about a certain amount of work. This time around we got an assignment
        to make a website. Immediately I thought of this little project. Great, let's combine hobby and study, what a
        great idea, I'm sure nothing bad is gonna happen.</p>
      <p>Let me start by saying this, to be fair, this project is a bit more advanced than what the assignment was
        requesting, but I just couldn't help myself. At first it seemed like a good idea for a while, but as time passed
        it became abundantly clear that I overscaled the project and am not going to have enough time to finish
        everything by the
        due date.</p>
      <p>But my luck was found in the detail. As I previously mentioned, the project is more advanced than the
        assignment and there we go. I can only make the parts of it that are important for the assignment and finish the
        whole thing later. Now that sounds doable.</p>
      <h3>saving time by not doing the required work</h3>
      <p>So the assignment has two parts, the project and a report. The project is this website, but a report can't just
        be an afterthought. As I was running out of time I remembered the professor telling us that we can include the
        report in our website. So instead of writing and formatting a Word document, I figured I'd do this page instead.
      </p>
      <p>The idea was good, but the reality of it is that it has taken around 3h to write to this point and I'm still
        not done, with the project as a whole or writing out this page (let alone finished with revising this massive
        wall of text).</p>
      <h3>forgetting to finish this</h3>
      <p>I can already see myself panicking about how I forgot to finish this <i>great wall of text</i> after submitting
        the project. But that's just how life is from time to time I guess and as they say "don't cry over spilled
        milk".</p>
      <p>To whom it may concern, if you find this documentation about the process of building this website lacking,
        please kindly check the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/markman4897/scribbly">source code</a> for
        potential updates before lowering the grade
        of the assignment. Thank you in advance.</p>
