        <h2>the story behind this website</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for this website randomly arose one day, when I was playing a
          game of <a class="link" href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> with
          my friends and something bothered me. Specifically I didn't like how
          it's kind of annoying that your custom word list doesn't get saved in
          browser, so you need to save it manually not to lose it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an unrelated note, not long before I was trying to make a game that
          would include a multiplayer element. Whilst browsing for ways to
          incorporate it, I found WebRTC.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when I was thinking about things I would add to
          <a class="link" href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> I remembered
          about this WebRTC thing and figured it would be a good practise to try
          to remake the fun drawing game in my own style.
        </p>
        <h3>Why I never finish projects</h3>
        <p>
          So starting this fine endeavour, I asked around a bit if anyone has
          tried to do this or something similar. You know, to get some tips on
          how to best approach this. While noone in my close friends group ever
          made a similar project, almost everyone advised to use some sort of
          CSS framework. I'm not kidding, literally
          <strong>everyone.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, as per usual, I said to myself "alright, lets make a
          vanilla CSS mockup and then we'll see". And this was the start of my
          demise.
        </p>
        <h3>Lucky strike with finding learning resources</h3>
        <p>
          First things first. If I want to even come close to making a
          <a class="link" href="https://skribbl.io/">Skribbl.io</a> clone I'd
          need to make a very basic drawing application. And so the Googling
          journey begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly enough, the
          <a
            title="dev.to article"
            class="link"
            href="https://dev.to/0shuvo0/lets-create-a-drawing-app-with-js-4ej3"
            >first result</a
          >
          had everything I needed. I quickly <s>copied over</s> learned about
          how to make a basic drawing app. A few modifications and BAM! Drawing
          part done.
        </p>
        <h3>There's more than one way to browse the web</h3>
        <p>
          Different people have different needs. That's an undisputable fact
          that should always be included into website development (among other
          things, of course). And by that I don't just mean people with
          disabilities, but also mean to point out that different people can
          have different preferences when it comes to browsing the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm no expert when it comes to accessibility, but I learned that there
          is a point to links having underlines and different colours and
          buttons changing visually when hovered over. The point is general
          recognition. People are more likely to notice that something is
          clickable if it looks like clickable things on other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also other things, as having a familiar layout of navigation
          elements and navigation through the clickable things with the tab key.
          Another important one is knowing when to use a specific HTML element
          as they usually have a
          <a
            title="article about HTML semantics"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics"
            class="link"
            >semantic</a
          >
          meaning along with the functional one. And if you are ready to go the
          extra mile, there's
          <a
            title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA"
            class="link"
            >ARIA</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Fun with CSS</h3>
        <p>
          So I have a love/hate relationship with CSS. I find its capabilities
          amazing and there's always something new "made with only CSS" that is
          just mind bending. When they added CSS Grids and Flexbox I felt like I
          can make any layout in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then there's practical side. While I learned all my CSS from just
          fooling around with it and have accumulated knowledge for more years
          than I care to admit, there's always that one little thing that
          catches you off guard, something that doesn't quite work as it seems.
          If you ever written any, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
        </p>
        <p>
          What this boils down to is me, sitting behind a computer at 4am,
          thinking about how to make a box keep its darn aspect ratio when
          everything around it is responsive. And this leads to rewriting the
          whole CSS file, from ground up, for the 5th time... and the aspect
          ratio is still not fixed... and I just need sleep at this point.
        </p>
        <h3>Things take a weird turn</h3>
        <p>
          So at weird hours come weird ideas. After a few days of minimal sleep
          and a sleeping schedule of a vampire, I need a break. And what better
          way to relax than to listen to some chill music. And that, at least
          for me, would be old jazz.
        </p>
        <p>
          While searching for the right playlist I came across online jazz
          radios. Interesting. And jazz can be pretty old some times. Okay.
          Connect the two together and you find old public domain online jazz
          radio station. Fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because of sleep depravation and sudden spike of jazz
          appreciation, I get the bright idea to try and add this radio station
          onto my website. Lo and behold, it's pretty simple and 10 minutes
          later, we have a nice button at the top right that toggles the
          playback of the online radio station. Cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this arises a question. While usage of public domain material is
          fair game (most of the time), what about this specific radio station.
          The short and the long answer is "I don't know". If you, the reader,
          know more about this, please contact me via service you can find on
          the <a class="link" href="author.html">author</a> page.
        </p>
        <h3>Actually thinking through CSS</h3>
        <p>
          After a crushing defeat at the battle of CSS I finally came to my
          senses and decided to plan things out. I sat down in front of a blank
          piece of paper and drawn a phone, tablet and monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, they were just different sized squares and I planned out a
          desired look for this webpage. A few iterations later I had something
          that made sense and started to rework the entire CSS file for the n-th
          time. But this time I had a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          First things first, I decided to pursuit a
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00"
            class="link"
            >mobile first approach</a
          >. This made things significantly easier and I have no idea why I
          never start like this. There's just something in the paper that makes
          me remember about this. But tl;dr: you should always plan first,
          before starting to write CSS files to oblivion and back.
        </p>
        <h3>Blissful ignorance</h3>
        <p>
          This should also be the time to plan the positioning of HTML
          attributes and think about general accessiblity. And to a degree, I
          did all that. But it's really easy to slip and think things through
          with a "design first, accessibility second" kind of approach and this
          is almost always a bad idea. But sometimes you just forget certain
          things. Good thing websites are not set in stone after you publish
          them.
        </p>
        <h3>the CSS gods show mercy</h3>
        <p>
          Usually when you don't know how to do something, you google it. But
          when you don't even know how to pose a question, you ask your
          developer friends (the only people willing to listen to your idea long
          enough to understand it).
        </p>
        <p>
          Funny thing is that some times (dare I say most of the time), after
          you explain your problem to a person, you gain some clarity about it
          yourself. So it even helps if you explain things to peolpe who don't
          necessarily know how to code just for that reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skip forward and after who knows how many iterations of CSS, I finally
          got it to play somewhat nicely. That mainly means nothing gets
          magically hidden or grows out of control at certain screen sizes. This
          is the time to try to open your website on every device you own and
          not forget about <strong>screen orientation</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>oh hey, i can use this</h3>
        <p>
          I'm studying informatics and that brings about a certain amount of
          work. This time around we got an assignment to make a website.
          Immediately I thought of this little project. Great, let's combine
          hobby and study, what a great idea, I'm sure nothing bad is gonna
          happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me start by saying this, to be fair, this project is a bit more
          advanced than what the assignment was requesting, but I just couldn't
          help myself. At first it seemed like a good idea for a while, but as
          time passed it became abundantly clear that I overscaled the project
          and am not going to have enough time to finish everything by the due
          date.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my luck was found in the detail. As I previously mentioned, the
          project is more advanced than the assignment and there we go. I can
          only make the parts of it that are important for the assignment and
          finish the whole thing later. Now that sounds doable.
        </p>
        <h3>saving time by not doing the required work</h3>
        <p>
          So the assignment has two parts, the project and a report. The project
          is this website, but a report can't just be an afterthought. As I was
          running out of time I remembered the professor telling us that we can
          include the report in our website. So instead of writing and
          formatting a Word document, I figured I'd do this page instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea was good, but the reality of it is that it has taken around
          3h to write to this point and I'm still not done, with the project as
          a whole or writing out this page (let alone finished with revising
          this massive wall of text).
        </p>
        <h3>CSS corrections - final edition</h3>
        <p>
          about mydevice.io and landscape media query and learning about aspect
          ration media queries
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, let's go back to square C, meaning of course the CSS. As
          expected we're not nearly done with the style part of this website and
          things continue not to work in one way or another. The biggest problem
          of all still being how the drawing app still doesn't look good on
          mobile or tablet. The biggest problem is the landscape orientation
          where we want the canvas area to take up as much of the screen as
          possible while still keeping the 4:3 aspect ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's examine the problem from a distance. Why am I having such a
          big problem styling it the way I want it to look. I mean PC is in
          landscape too, why is it so much trouble on smaller devices? Well the
          thing is that the phone is much smaller than a monitor and that your
          browsers address bar etc takes much of the vertical space. So we
          really want to maximise the height of the canvas element as much as
          possible because after all, you can't really draw anything if the
          canvas is only about two thumbs high.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can't really keep the same layout of the elements as in portrait
          orientation, mainly because the tools area take up much of the
          precious vertical space, so the only way is to position them on the
          side, where we have extra space since phones are pretty long these
          days.
        </p>
        <h3>new game features</h3>
        <p>
          So while I was watching people use the drawing page, I noticed they
          were always searching for something that wasn't there. Now the
          specific things they were searching for were different brushes, undo
          button and even a load button so they could continue from where they
          left. But there was always one thing that everyone was missing. An
          eraser.
        </p>
        <p>
          And from all of the requests, this one was the easiest to implement so
          there was really no excuse not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing I noticed was that while choosing colours, people forgot
          which colour they selected or didn't know if they hit or missed the
          button. So I added a function that colours all the circles of brush
          size selection to the currently selected colour.
        </p>
        <h3>one page is not like the others</h3>
        <p>
          So nothing on this website is super complex, be it layout or content.
          It's pretty simple to reorganise the layout to work in mobile
          portrait, desktop landscape or anything in between. But that's not
          really the case for the drawing page where we really need the canvas
          to take as much space as possible and always keep its aspect ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is the first time that I actually need to think not just about
          width but also about screen orientation when defining media queries.
          Because there is a big difference if you try to draw with a tablet in
          portrait or a mobile phone in landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution here is moving the tools bar from the top of canvas to
          the side when a device that is smaller than desktop is used. This
          immediately helps a lot, but I realise that moving the canvas besides
          the normal flow of the webpage would be even better, though maybe that
          wouldn't look as nice. I might revisit this in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also the point where I noticed that my previous CSS solutions
          for holding the aspect ratio of the canvas were more of a hack than a
          real solution, which became painfully obvious when canvas deformed
          while viewing the website on a tablet in landscape orientation.
        </p>
        <h3>but this works on my device</h3>
        <p>
          After dealing with the canvas aspect ratio problem I realised that my
          media query breakpoints were all over the place by now. While it does
          help to set them based on content rather than trying to cater for
          every device, having a solid base breakpoints is much more useful.
          <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862"
            class="link"
            >This article</a
          >
          along with a
          <a href="https://www.mydevice.io/" class="link"
            >website that shows your devices screen metrics</a
          >
          helped me immensly with setting sensible base breakpoints that should
          be quite future-proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also realised that it's unrealistic to try to draw on a mobile
          device in landscape orientation and that's why I also added a message
          that asks you to rotate your device in this case. There's just no nice
          way to display canvas in that specific case with my website layout as
          it is right now.
        </p>
        <h3>calm before the storm</h3>
        <p>
          Okay... now "everything seems to work", says every developer before
          everything breaks. But seriously, things are pretty functional at this
          point and I can't find any problems across my devices. Things are
          finally good.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that I can finally start tackling the main goal of this
          whole project, learning and implementing WebRTC for multiplayer
          functionality. (but we're not really done yet, are we...)
        </p>
        <h3>okay, just one more thing</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important things to do before you can consider a
          project "usable" is to ask people to try it out and see what bugs,
          edge cases, ... they can find that you didn't encounter yourself.
          Which is easy enough if you have a super popular project that
          thousands or even millions of users are eagerly anticipating the
          release of. But that's not the case here.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I might have previously mentioned, it's kind of hard to persuade
          your friends to continuously test your broken project because it gets
          boring real quick. And if I'm honest, everyone has something
          better/more important to do than test my broken app. But if you make
          enough changes and first test them out yourself, you can still manage
          to make the changes interesting enough for people to at least want to
          try it out briefly again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added more pictures to the gallery page. It loads quick enough
          because they're all optimised but I know this won't be enough in the
          long run. So for that reason I also implemented the
          <code>loading="lazy"</code> attribute that should help in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>forgetting to finish this</h3>
        <p>
          I can already see myself panicking about how I forgot to finish this
          <i>great wall of text</i> after submitting the project. But that's
          just how life is from time to time I guess and as they say "it's no
          use crying over spilled milk".
